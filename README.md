## Why this project was made?
I wanted to expand to another language besides JavaScript, that was server-side so I thought the best one to learn was PHP. It's quite simple and use it with MySQL to create and manipulate a database was a fun experience.

## Conclusion
If you want a simple project to learn the most possible about server-side and database stuff, I really recommend doing something like this one.
